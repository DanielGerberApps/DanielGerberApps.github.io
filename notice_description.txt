*If sounds are not playing after upgrading, simply reinstall the app and it should resolve the issue. Apologies for the hassle!

*Alarms from the old version will not appear anymore. This is due to changing the backend of the app and is not expected to happen again.

*I've received a lot of feedback about the new UI. Please email me your thoughts as I look to further improve the app!
