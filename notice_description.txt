*Alarms from the old version will not appear anymore. This is due to changing the backend of the app and is not expected to happen again.

*If sounds are not playing after upgrading, simply reinstall the app and it should resolve the issue. Apologies for the hassle!

*An issue with the custom ringtone recorder has been fixed.
